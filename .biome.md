# Biome Configuration

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting, integrated with Turborepo and Husky for pre-commit checks.

## Setup

The configuration is already set up. When you clone the repository and run `bun install`, Husky will be automatically initialized via the `prepare` script.

## Available Scripts

### Root Level

- `bun run lint` - Run linting across all workspaces
- `bun run lint:fix` - Automatically fix linting issues across all workspaces
- `bun run format` - Format all files across all workspaces
- `bun run format:check` - Check if files are formatted correctly
- `bun run check` - Run both format check and lint (used in pre-commit hook)

### Workspace Level

Each workspace (`apps/realtime`, `apps/desktop`, `apps/workers`) has the same scripts:

- `bun run lint` - Run linting in the workspace
- `bun run lint:fix` - Fix linting issues in the workspace
- `bun run format` - Format files in the workspace
- `bun run format:check` - Check formatting in the workspace

## Pre-commit Hook

Husky is configured to run format and lint checks before each commit. If there are any errors:

1. The commit will be blocked
2. You'll see error messages indicating what needs to be fixed
3. Run `bun run format` to fix formatting issues
4. Run `bun run lint:fix` to fix linting issues
5. Try committing again

## Configuration

The Biome configuration is in `biome.json` at the root of the repository. Key settings:

- **Line width**: 100 characters
- **Indent**: 2 spaces
- **Quote style**: Single quotes for JS/TS, double quotes for JSX
- **Semicolons**: Always
- **Trailing commas**: ES5 style
- **Import organization**: Enabled (automatically sorts imports)

## Bypassing Pre-commit Checks

If you absolutely need to bypass the pre-commit checks (not recommended):

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "your message"
```

## IDE Integration

For the best experience, install the Biome extension for your IDE:

- **VS Code**: [Biome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome)
- Configure format on save in your editor settings
